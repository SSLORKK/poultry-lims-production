# All Samples Filter Panel Update

Due to the large size of the required changes, I'm creating this replacement section for the filter panel.

This needs to replace lines 548-697 in AllSamples.tsx with a multiselect dropdown pattern matching PCRSamples.tsx

The new filter panel will include:
1. Active filter chips for all selected filters
2. Multiselect dropdowns with checkboxes for each filter type
3. Select All / Deselect All buttons
4. Better UX with scrollable dropdowns
